/*
In this problem we are given with 2 arrays 1 length[] and price[]
Now we have to cut the rod in such a way that when we add the price of the rods we get
maximum profit.Also you may not be given length array then you
consider the array from 1 to N where N is included.
this problem is the same as weight value and max sum or same as unbounded knapsack code
we just change wt(weight) with length
